# sudarshan/watchlists/ - Watchlists v2 (M8.4 onwards)

Rules, contract and words for the multi-list watchlist features. Everything here is switched off
until `SUDARSHAN_WATCHLISTS_V2` is turned on. The pure modules take every input as an argument and do
no I/O, no clock and no logging; words a trader reads live in `words/<feature>.py`. This folder
starts no thread, timer or event loop. Tests: `sudarshan/watchlists/tests/` (vectors in
`tests/vectors/`, typed by hand, never made by the code they test).

## W3 - the contract (`contract.py`, `gentypes.py`)

`contract.py` holds every op of the owner's bridge once: method, path, class, request fields and the
record each answers with, plus the enums, the limits (50 lists, 250 symbols, 20 sections, 120-row
window ...), the error codes and the write routes. `gentypes.py` writes
`frontend/src/sudarshan/watchlist/v2/types.ts` from it; run
`python -m sudarshan.watchlists.gentypes` after a change, and `--check` (also a test) fails when the
file differs. Never edit `types.ts` by hand. A later contract change is its own PR and merges before
the phone PR that uses it.
